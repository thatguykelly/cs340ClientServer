Portfolio of Projects for the Computer Science class Client Server Development from SNHU

To keep programs maintainable, readable and adaptable I need to follow the developer guidelines for each language. This takes some time to research and know when and where things need to be a certain way. I try to keep the code as short as possible while commenting enough to let a viewer know what a certain block of code's intention is. Following whitespace guidelines is great for readability.I will be taking action to make sure my code is short and easy on variables to make it adaptable. There may be small changes if I need to implement a function elsewhere but I will try to make it as minimal as possible.

I'm becoming more and more a fan of the pseudocode. I like to try and write things out first. Gives me a base to build from. Other ideas may happen while running it through the pseudocode first. Python and MongoDB guides were a big help to me this term. I will be referencing a languages documentation files in the future. I liked learning about the callback functions and how they incorporate with the data. I will be furthuring my knowledge in that department.

Computer scientists are curious individuals by nature. We want to make a system better and more efficient. The process for Grazioso Salvare to find potential candidates has just been streamlined in a very effective manner. This matters because we as computer scientists are furthuring technolgy. Making it easier and cost effective to accomplish big ideas.
